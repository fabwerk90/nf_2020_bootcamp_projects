<h1>FC Python Data Visualization</h1>

<h2>An interactive explorer for actual and predicted market values of football players</h2>

<p>
Each player is represented via a circle. To see individual attributes of each player simply hover over the circles. 
<br />
<br />
Interact with the widgets on the left to select different players, depending on their age, rating from the FIFA20 video game or their position on the field. 
You can also search individual players by using the text input at the left bottom (you can put the whole name or just a few letters).
<br />
<br />
Please also have a look at the bottom right of the figure. There you can find tools to zoom in, change the view, disable/enable the crosshair 
or save your current configurations & settings of the figure.
</p>
<b>Feel free to explore and have fun!</b>
